Statement -
	John got bored of his worthless single life and decided to find a partner.
	To help him out, you invited him into a bar, the bar had N girls, named from 0 to N-1, seeing the ugly face of John all the girls turned away from him to face the wall.
	Being the cool dude you are, you somehow persuaded the girls to atleast talk with John if he asks them to. seeing this, John thanks you from the bottom of his heart and begins his talk with the girls
	by performing two types of operations:
		1) Flip all girls named between A and B inclusive. This is represented by the command "0 A B" (here flip means that if a girl is facing the wall, she would start facing John and vice-versa) 
		2) Answer how many girls between between A and B inclusive can John talk to. This is represented by the command "1 A B".

INPUT -
	The first line contains two integers, N and Q. Each of the next Q lines are either of the form "0 A B" or "1 A B" as mentioned above. 
	1 <= N <= 10^5
	1 <= Q <= 10^5
	0 <= A <= B <= N - 1

OUTPUT -
	Output 1 line for each of the queries of the form "1 A B" containing the required answer for the corresponding query.
