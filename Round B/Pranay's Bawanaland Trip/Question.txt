Statement -	
	As if not caring about the lockdown, Pranay went on a trip to Bawanaland.
	There his passport was robbed by the renegade Snek, Ritik. Being a fair and just Snek, Ritik offered Pranay a game to wing back his passport.
	Obviously, Pranay agreed and by the spirits of mongoose, he won back his passport, leaving the Snek to back into it's books.
	Now let's leave Pranay alone and focus on the said game.
	You have been given 2 integers X and Y, you can perform 2 types of operations:
		1) Pay 'a' fucchas (the local currency of Bawanaland), and decrease or increase ANY of these integers by 1.
		2) Pay 'b' fucchas, and decrease or increase BOTH of the integers by 1.
	Your goal is to make both the integers equal to zero simultaneously (X = Y = 0).
	Calculate the minimum amount of fucchas you need to spend to do it.

INPUT - 
	First line contains, T (1 - 100), the number of testcases.
	The first line of each T contains 2 integers X and Y (0 - 10^9)
	The second line of each T contains 2 integers a and b (0 - 10^9)

OUTPUT -
	For each test case print one integer â€” the minimum amount of fucchas you have to spend.
