Statement - 
	Garvit was holding a birthday party, however no-one came to attend it as he had no friends.
	To fight boredom (and sadness) he decided to play a game!
	For that he gifted himself a string S, and 2 empty strings T and U.
	The game has two possible moves - 
		•Extract the first character of S and append T with this character. 
		•Extract the last character of T and append U with this character.
	The goal of the game is to get strings S and T empty and string U lexicographically minimal.
	You decided to try the game out yourself and write the code that would help you win the game everytime.

INPUT - 
	First line contains non-empty string S (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5), consisting of lowercase English letters.

Scoring - 
	300

OUTPUT -
	Print resulting string U.
